# White River Citizen Quest Fix

When using a map with little to no plains biome, the white river citizen quest will fail because it requires there to be a trader in the plains to target. This 
modlet removes this restriction so the quest is playable in other biomes.

# Compatibility

Works with Alpha 20. Not tested with previous Alphas but may still work.

#Changelog

- v1.0 - Initial release
